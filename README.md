# KnowledgeWall | check the users knowledge on a subject before releasing content

As a fresh graduate I wanted to put my CV on my site who knows what it could bring. Not wanting my personal info to be scraped or merely added to a bottomless pit by recruiters I decided to build a tiny proof of concept. The snippet is nothing more than a tiny python script that validates a single post request.

## Set-up

Everything is hosted freely on the Google App Engine. Start by making a google account and creating a new project (note your `project ID`) in your [GAE console](https://console.cloud.google.com). Finally you will need the [GAE SDK](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/download) for python.

```sh
<script src="js/cordova-bitcore.js"></script>
```
